## Introduction

This repository is a personal project where I solve LeetCode problems using TypeScript. It serves as a way to practice and improve my problem-solving skills, as well as to provide a reference for others who are interested in TypeScript solutions for LeetCode challenges.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
leetcode-ts/
│
├── easy/
│   └── *.test.ts  # Tests for easy-level problems
├── medium/
│   └── *.test.ts  # Tests for medium-level problems
├── hard/
│   └── *.test.ts  # Tests for hard-level problems
├── bun.lockb
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pragusga25/leetcode-ts.git
